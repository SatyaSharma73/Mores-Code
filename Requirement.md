##  Pygame Installation
### Install pygame in Windows

Before installing Pygame, Python should be installed in the system, and it is good to have 3.6.1 or above version because it is much friendlier to beginners, and additionally runs faster. There are mainly two ways to install Pygame, which are given below:

**1. Installing through pip:**  The good way to install Pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). The command is the following:

1.  py -m pip install -U pygame --user

**2. Installing through an IDE:**  The second way is to install it through an IDE and here we are using Pycharm IDE. Installation of pygame in the pycharm is straightforward. We can install it by running the above command in the terminal or use the following steps:

-   Open the  **File**  tab and click on the  **Settings**  option.

To check whether the pygame is properly installed or not, in the IDLE interpreter, type the following command and press Enter:

 import pygame

If the command runs successfully without throwing any errors, it means we have successfully installed Pygame and found the correct version of IDLE to use for pygame programming.
